* Context
In my employment, I pretty much exclusively work with Go. While I take
performance and such into consideration when writing code, I haven't dealt with
anything that has hit the limits of the Go runtime. I'm trying to get better
with Rust so I'd like to see what a gRPC-based microservice would look like in
Rust.
